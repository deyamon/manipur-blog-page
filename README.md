# 🌄 Explore Manipur – Culture • Cuisine • Places • Sports • Interactive

**Explore Manipur** is a visually rich, multi-page web project showcasing the
culture, food, landscapes, martial arts, and traditional sports of Manipur.
Built as part of a college project, it blends clean design with interactive UI
elements like expanding cards, hover-reveals, image overlays, and smooth
animations.

The goal is simple:  
to create a digital window into Manipur’s heritage — modern, minimal, and
beautiful.
